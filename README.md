# CS142 - Algorithm Engineering

A deep dive into algorithm theory and implementation, focusing on:
1. Numerics and Sorting
2. Error Correction and Compression
3. Cryptography
4. Memory and Memory Performance

## Numerics and Sorting
- sqrt
  - Newton's method
  - Speed vs. Accuracy tradeoffs
  - [IEEE 754](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html)
  - SIMD Vectorization w/ AVX-512
  - Cache optimization w/ data prefetching
